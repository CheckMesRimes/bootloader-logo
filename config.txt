# The image is specified with an image line.
# Multiple image lines may be present, in which case one will be picked by random.
# The image line may contain the following parts:
# Any of the following:
#  - "n=(number)", a weight for this image in the randomization process. Default: n=1.
#  - "x=(number)" or "x=keep", the x offset from the center. Default: x=0.
#  - "y=(number)" or "y=keep", the y offset from the center. Default: y=0.
# One of the following:
#  - "keep" to keep the firmware logo. Also keeps coordinates by default.
#  - "remove" to remove the BGRT. Makes x and y meaningless.
#  - "black" to use only a black image. Makes x and y meaningless.
#  - "path=..." to read a BMP file.
#    * NOTE: For path=\EFI\HackBGRT\*, the installer will copy and convert the file if necessary.
#    * NOTE: For other paths, make sure that the file is a 24-bit BMP file with a 54-byte header.
#    * NOTE: The file must be on the EFI System Partition. Do not add a drive letter!
# Examples:
#  - image=remove
#  - image=black
#  - image= x=0 y=-200 path=\EFI\HackBGRT\topimage.bmp
#  - image=n=1,path=\EFI\HackBGRT\splash.bmp
#  - image=n=50,path=\EFI\HackBGRT\probable.bmp
# The above examples together would produce
#  - 1/54 chance for the default OS logo
#  - 1/54 chance for black screen
#  - 1/54 chance for topimage.bmp, 200 px above the center of the screen
#  - 1/54 chance for splash.bmp, automatically positioned
#  - 50/54 chance for probable.bmp, automatically positioned
# Default: just one image.
